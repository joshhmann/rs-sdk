# RS-Agent Bot Guide

You're here to play the mmo game through the progressive development of botting scripts, starting small then adapting to your desires and ideas.

## First Time Setup

**Create a new bot using the setup script:**

Ask the user for a bot name (max 12 chars, alphanumeric). If they skip, use the command without a username to auto-generate a random 9-character name.

```bash
# With custom username
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username}

# Auto-generate random username
bun scripts/create-bot.ts

# Use local server (sets SERVER=localhost in bot.env)
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username} --local

# Use a custom server
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username} --server=myserver.example.com
```

This automatically creates:
- `bots/{username}/bot.env` - Credentials with auto-generated password
- `bots/{username}/lab_log.md` - Session notes template
- `bots/{username}/script.ts` - Ready-to-run starter script

## MCP Integration (Interactive Mode)

The MCP server auto-discovers via `.mcp.json` when you open the project in Claude Code.

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `bun install` (from project root)
2. Open project in Claude Code — approve the MCP server when prompted
3. Control your bot with suggestions.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_code(bot_name, code)` | Run code on a bot. Auto-connects on first use. |
| `list_bots()` | List connected bots |
| `disconnect_bot(name)` | Disconnect a bot |

### Example

```typescript
// Just execute - auto-connects on first use
execute_code({
  bot_name: "mybot",
  code: `
    const state = sdk.getState();
    console.log('Position:', state.player.worldX, state.player.worldZ);

    // Chop trees for 1 minute
    const endTime = Date.now() + 60_000;
    while (Date.now() < endTime) {
      const tree = sdk.findNearbyLoc(/^tree$/i);
      if (tree) await bot.chopTree(tree);
    }

    return sdk.getInventory();
  `
})
```


**When to use MCP vs Scripts:**
- **MCP**: One-off fixes, probing, experimenting, quick state checks
- **Scripts**: Anything running in a loop, long-running automation, reproducible tasks, version control

See `mcp/README.md` for detailed API reference.

## Script Runner API

Scripts should leverage `runScript` to manage their connections, initialization, and timeouts.
Make new scripts for different skills, for instance fishing.ts, woodcutting.ts, combat.ts, etc.
You may also wish to import or re-use code between them.

**Run scripts:**
```bash
bun bots/{username}/script.ts
```

The runner automatically finds `bot.env` in the same directory as the script. Alternative methods:
- `bun script.ts {botname}` - loads `bots/{botname}/bot.env`
- `bun --env-file=bots/{name}/bot.env script.ts` - explicit env file

```typescript
// bots/mybot/woodcutter.ts
import { runScript } from '../../sdk/runner';

const result = await runScript(async (ctx) => {
  const { bot, sdk, log } = ctx;

  let logsChopped = 0;

  while (logsChopped < 50) {
    const tree = sdk.findNearbyLoc(/^tree$/i);
    if (tree) {
      const r = await bot.chopTree(tree);
      if (r.success) logsChopped++;
    }
  }

  log(`Chopped ${logsChopped} logs`);
  return { logsChopped };
}, {
  timeout: 3 * 60_000,  // 3 minute timeout
});

console.log(`Success: ${result.success}`);
```

### ScriptContext

Scripts receive a context object with:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `bot` | BotActions instance (high-level actions) |
| `sdk` | BotSDK instance (low-level SDK) |
| `log` | Captured logging (like console.log) |
| `warn` | Captured warnings |
| `error` | Captured errors |

### RunOptions

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `timeout` | none | Overall timeout in ms |
| `autoConnect` | true | Connect if not connected |
| `disconnectAfter` | false | Disconnect when done |

### RunResult

```typescript
interface RunResult {
  success: boolean;
  result?: any;           // Return value from script
  error?: Error;          // If failed
  duration: number;       // Total ms
  logs: LogEntry[];       // Captured logs
  finalState: BotWorldState;
}
```

The runner automatically prints formatted world state after execution 

## Session Workflow

This is a **persistent character** - you don't restart fresh each time. The workflow is:

### 1. Check World State First

Before writing any script, check where the bot is and what it has:

```bash
bun sdk/cli.ts {username}
```

This shows: position, inventory, skills, nearby NPCs/objects, and more.

**Exception**: Skip this if you just created the character and know it's at spawn.

**Tutorial Check**: If the character is in the tutorial area, call `await bot.skipTutorial()` before running any other scripts. The tutorial blocks normal gameplay.

### 2. Write Your Script

Edit `bots/{username}/script_name.ts` with your goal. Keep scripts focused on one task. you may write multiple scripts for different tasks and switch between them.

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
bun bots/{username}/script_name.ts
```

### 4. Observe and Iterate

Watch the output. After the script finishes (or fails), check state again:

```bash
bun sdk/cli.ts {username}
```

Record observations in `lab_log.md`, then improve the script.

## Script Duration Guidelines

**Start short, extend as you gain confidence:**

| Duration | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| **10-30s** | New script, single actions, untested logic, debugging |
| **2-5 min** | Validated approach, building confidence |
| **10+ min** | Proven strategy, grinding runs. USE SPARINGLY |

A failed 5-minute run wastes more time than five 30 second diagnostic runs. **Fail fast and start simple.**

Be extremely cognizant of pathing issues. It's very common to have issues because of closed doors and gates.
Look out for "I can't reach" messages - the solution is often to open closed gates. 

Read and grep in the learnings folder for tips.

## SDK API Reference

For the complete method reference, see **[sdk/API.md](sdk/API.md)** (auto-generated from source).

**Quick overview:**
- `bot.*` - High-level actions that wait for effects to complete (chopTree, walkTo, attackNpc, etc.)
- `sdk.*` - Low-level methods that resolve on server acknowledgment (sendWalk, getState, findNearbyNpc, etc.)

---

### Dismiss Level-Up Dialogs

All BotActions methods automatically dismiss blocking UI (level-up dialogs, etc.) before executing. You don't need to call this manually in loops.

```typescript
// Only needed if using low-level sdk methods directly:
await bot.dismissBlockingUI();

// Or manually check
if (sdk.getState()?.dialog.isOpen) {
    await sdk.sendClickDialog(0);
}
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
const result = await bot.chopTree();
if (!result.success) {
    console.log(`Failed: ${result.message}`);
    // Handle failure - maybe walk somewhere else
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**"No state received"** - Bot isn't connected to game. Open browser first or use `autoLaunchBrowser: true`.

**Script stalls** - Check for open dialogs (`state.dialog.isOpen`). Level-ups block everything.

**"Can't reach"** - Path is blocked. Try walking closer first, or find a different target.

**Wrong target** - Use more specific regex patterns: `/^tree$/i` not `/tree/i` (which matches "tree stump").
