/**
 * Attack Out of Reach Test (SDK)
 * Tests the attackNpc failure mode when trying to attack an NPC through an obstacle.
 *
 * Scenario:
 * - Position the player outside the Lumbridge cow field gate
 * - Try to attack a cow inside the fenced area
 * - Verify that attackNpc returns success: false with reason: 'out_of_reach'
 *
 * This tests the waitForCombat option of bot.attackNpc() which detects
 * "I can't reach that!" messages from the server.
